        This algorithm, called CNF, should satisfy the following requirements:<br>
(1) CNF terminates for all formulas of propositional logic as input;<br>
(2) for each such input, CNF outputs an equivalent formula; and<br>
(3) all output computed by CNF is in CNF.<br> <br>
			The application of IMPL FREE might introduce double negations into the
output formula. More importantly, negations whose scopes are non-atomic
formulas might still be present. For example, the formula p ∧¬(p ∧ q) has
such a negation with p ∧ q as its scope. Essentially, the question is whether
one can efficiently compute a CNF for ¬φ from a CNF for φ. Since nobody
seems to know the answer, we circumvent the question by translating ¬φinto an equivalent formula that contains only negations of atoms. Formulas
which only negate atoms are said to be in negation normal form (NNF). We
spell out such a procedure, NNF, in detail later on. The key to its specification
for implication-free formulas lies in the de Morgan rules. The second phase
of the preprocessing, therefore, calls NNF with the implication-free output of
IMPL FREE to obtain an equivalent formula in NNF.
After all this preprocessing, we obtain a formula φ	 which is the result of
the call NNF (IMPL FREE (φ)). Note that φ	 ≡ φ since both algorithms only
transform formulas into equivalent ones. Since φ	 contains no occurrences
of → and since only atoms in φ	 are negated, we may program CNF by an
analysis of only three cases: literals, conjunctions and disjunctions.<br>
 If φ is a literal, it is by definition in CNF and so CNF outputs φ.<br>
 If φ equals φ1 ∧ φ2, we call CNF recursively on each φi to get the respective output
ηi and return the CNF η1 ∧ η2 as output for input φ.<br>
 If φ equals φ1 ∨ φ2, we again call CNF recursively on each φi to get the respective
output ηi; but this time we must not simply return η1 ∨ η2 since that formula is
certainly not in CNF, unless η1 and η2 happen to be literals.<br>

Notice how the calling of DISTR is done with the computed conjunctive normal
forms of φ1 and φ2. The routine DISTR has η1 and η2 as input parameters
and does a case analysis on whether these inputs are conjunctions. What
should DISTR do if none of its input formulas is such a conjunction? Well,
since we are calling DISTR for inputs η1 and η2 which are in CNF, this can
only mean that η1 and η2 are literals, or disjunctions of literals. Thus, η1 ∨ η2
is in CNF.
Otherwise, at least one of the formulas η1 and η2 is a conjunction. Since
one conjunction suffices for simplifying the problem, we have to decide which
conjunct we want to transform if both formulas are conjunctions. That way
we maintain that our algorithm CNF is deterministic. So let us suppose that
η1 is of the form η11 ∧ η12. Then the distributive law says that η1 ∨ η2 ≡
(η11 ∨ η2) ∧ (η12 ∨ η2). Since all participating formulas η11, η12 and η2 are
in CNF, we may call DISTR again for the pairs (η11, η2) and (η12, η2), and
then simply form their conjunction. This is the key insight for writing the
function DISTR.
The case when η2 is a conjunction is symmetric and the structure of
the recursive call of DISTR is then dictated by the equivalence η1 ∨ η2 ≡
(η1 ∨ η21) ∧ (η1 ∨ η22), where η2 = η21 ∧ η22:<br>
function DISTR (η1, η2):<br>
/* precondition: η1 and η2 are in CNF */<br>
/* postcondition: DISTR (η1, η2) computes a CNF for η1 ∨ η2 */<br>
begin function<br>
case<br>
η1 is η11 ∧ η12 : return DISTR (η11, η2) ∧ DISTR (η12, η2)<br>
η2 is η21 ∧ η22 : return DISTR (η1, η21) ∧ DISTR (η1, η22)<br>
otherwise (= no conjunctions) : return η1 ∨ η2<br>
end case<br>
end function<br>
<br><br>
Again, we program NNF recursively by a case analysis over the structure of
the input formula φ. The last two examples already suggest a solution for two
of these clauses. In order to compute a NNF of ¬¬φ, we simply compute
a NNF of φ. This is a sound strategy since φ and ¬¬φ are semantically
equivalent. If φ equals ¬(φ1 ∧ φ2), we use the de Morgan rule ¬(φ1 ∧ φ2) ≡
¬φ1 ∨ ¬φ2 as a recipe for how NNF should call itself recursively in that case.
Dually, the case of φ being ¬(φ1 ∨ φ2) appeals to the other de Morgan rule
¬(φ1 ∨ φ2) ≡ ¬φ1 ∧ ¬φ2 and, if φ is a conjunction or disjunction, we simply
let NNF pass control to those subformulas. Clearly, all literals are in NNF.
The resulting code for NNF is thus<br>
function NNF (φ):<br>
/* precondition: φ is implication free */<br>
/* postcondition: NNF (φ) computes a NNF for φ */<br>
begin function<br>
case<br>
φ is a literal : return φ<br>
φ is ¬¬φ1 : return NNF (φ1)<br>
φ is φ1 ∧ φ2 : return NNF (φ1) ∧ NNF (φ2)<br>
φ is φ1 ∨ φ2 : return NNF (φ1) ∨ NNF (φ2)<br>
φ is ¬(φ1 ∧ φ2): return NNF (¬φ1) ∨ NNF (¬φ2)<br>
φ is ¬(φ1 ∨ φ2): return NNF (¬φ1) ∧ NNF (¬φ2)<br>
end case<br>
end function<br><br>

Notice that these cases are exhaustive due to the algorithm’s precondition.<br>
Given any formula φ of propositional logic, we may now convert it into an equivalent CNF by calling CNF (NNF (IMPL FREE (φ))). In the exercises, you
are asked to show that<br>
 all four algorithms terminate on input meeting their preconditions,<br>
 the result of CNF (NNF (IMPL FREE (φ))) is in CNF and,<br>
 that result is semantically equivalent to φ.<br><br>
Let us now illustrate the programs coded above on some concrete examples.
We begin by computing CNF (NNF (IMPL FREE (¬p ∧ q → p ∧ (r → q)))).
We show almost all details of this computation and you should compare this
with how you would expect the code above to behave. First, we compute
IMPL FREE (φ):
IMPL FREE (φ) = ¬IMPL FREE (¬p ∧ q) ∨ IMPL FREE (p ∧ (r → q))<br>
= ¬((IMPL FREE ¬p) ∧ (IMPL FREE q)) ∨ IMPL FREE (p ∧ (r → q))<br>
= ¬((¬p) ∧ IMPL FREE q) ∨ IMPL FREE (p ∧ (r → q))<br>
= ¬(¬p ∧ q) ∨ IMPL FREE (p ∧ (r → q))<br>
= ¬(¬p ∧ q) ∨ ((IMPL FREE p) ∧ IMPL FREE (r → q))<br>
= ¬(¬p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ IMPL FREE (r → q))<br>
= ¬(¬p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ (¬(IMPL FREE r) ∨ (IMPL FREE q)))<br>
= ¬(¬p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ (¬r ∨ (IMPL FREE q)))<br>
= ¬(¬p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q)).<br>
Second, we compute NNF (IMPL FREE φ):<br>
NNF (IMPL FREE φ) = NNF (¬(¬p ∧ q)) ∨ NNF (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q))<br>
= NNF (¬(¬p)∨ ¬q) ∨ NNF (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q))<br>
= (NNF (¬¬p)) ∨ (NNF (¬q)) ∨ NNF (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q))<br>
= (p ∨ (NNF (¬q))) ∨ NNF (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q))<br>
= (p∨ ¬q) ∨ NNF (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q))<br>
= (p∨ ¬q) ∨ ((NNF p) ∧ (NNF (¬r ∨ q)))<br>
= (p∨ ¬q) ∨ (p ∧ (NNF (¬r ∨ q)))<br>
= (p∨ ¬q) ∨ (p ∧ ((NNF (¬r)) ∨ (NNF q)))<br>
= (p∨ ¬q) ∨ (p ∧ (¬r ∨ (NNF q)))<br>
= (p∨ ¬q) ∨ (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q)).<br>
Third, we finish it off with<br>
CNF (NNF (IMPL FREE φ)) = CNF ((p ∨¬q) ∨ (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q)))<br>
= DISTR (CNF (p ∨¬q), CNF (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q)))<br>
= DISTR (p∨ ¬q, CNF (p ∧ (¬r ∨ q)))<br>
= DISTR (p∨ ¬q, p ∧ (¬r ∨ q))<br>
= DISTR (p∨ ¬q, p) ∧ DISTR (p∨ ¬q, ¬r ∨ q)<br>
= (p ∨¬q ∨ p) ∧ DISTR (p ∨¬q, ¬r ∨ q)<br>
= (p ∨¬q ∨ p) ∧ (p∨ ¬q ∨¬r ∨ q) .<br>
The formula (p∨ ¬q ∨ p) ∧ (p ∨¬q ∨ ¬r ∨ q) is thus the result of the call
CNF (NNF (IMPL FREE φ)) and is in conjunctive normal form and equivalent to
φ.
